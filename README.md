# Supernote-converter
Convert Supernote's `.note` files into `.pdf` files without using the "export" function on a real device.

This program is simply a GUI (graphical user interface) wrapper of [supernote-tool](https://github.com/jya-dev/supernote-tool), and is designed for those unfamiliar with `python` and command-line applications.

At the moment, only Windows is supported.

## Features
There is not much to say... the only "feature" at the moment is that the program remembers the last input and output paths used, so that they do not have to be entered again the next time you want to convert a note. These paths are stored in two text files `last_input_path.txt` and `last_output_path.txt` in the same folder where the main executable is contained.

## Download
Simply go to the [releases](https://github.com/francescoboc/supernote-converter/releases) page and follow the instructions.
